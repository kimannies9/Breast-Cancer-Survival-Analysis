Analysis of Different Features on Breast Cancer Survival Rate Using Machine Learning

The purpose of this study is to identify the important prognostic factors influencing the survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, various predictive algorithms were utilized to determine the survival rate by age, grade, and cancer characteristics at diagnosis. This study determines significant prognostic characteristics of breast cancer survival rate using machine learning methods, including KNN classifier, decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, and logistic regression. 

Dataset was obtained from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) breast cancer data from 2017. The SEER database is managed by the National Cancer Institute. It collects data on population, incidence, and survival data from population-based cancer registries in 18 states, representing 28 percent of the United States population. The study includes females with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2010. This specific data was pre-processed to have 4024 females with data in all classifications, including demographic, advanced-stage incidence rates, and mortality.
